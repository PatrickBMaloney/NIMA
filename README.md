## Description
Nima is a web application for students and professors/teachers that allows the students to relay their understanding of topics in a simple way as the topics are being taught. During class, the students rate their understanding of the content being taught on straight forward scales. This information is then relayed to the professor on their laptop as they are teaching in easy to understand averages and graphics.
